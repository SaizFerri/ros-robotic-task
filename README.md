## Description

In this project we develop a ROS application capable of taking a single image or a video stream of images with handwritten digits, process it and predict the digit using a neuronal network. The project is divided in three tasks. Task 1 is responsible for setting the basic structure of the ROS application. In task 2 we develop the synchronization of the topics and the service for the neuronal network. Finally in task 3, we build and train the model used to predict the digits on the images using pytorch.
